## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Here is the first new markdown section

This is a completely new section, made special for question 8 of lab 4

```{r}
print("hey I'm the code in the first new section. Nice to meet you.")

```

## Here is the second new markdown section

This is also a completely new section. It is totally different from the first new section.

```{r}
print("hey I'm the second section's code. How's it goin?")
```
